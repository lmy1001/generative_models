Exercise with generative models


1. To train the AutoEncoder and replicate the results on the Table 1, run 

    Train_Autoencoder.py

2. To train the vanilla_gan, run:

    Train_vanilla.py
    
3. To train the wgan, run:

  Train_wgan.py
  
4. To train the latent_gan, run:
    
    Train_Pointatlas_net.py
 
 then save the model and send into the Train_latent_gan.py, run:
 
    Train_latent_gan.py
    
 
 Todo:
 
    Fix the problem of loss didn't change.
    
    1, 3, 4 are all the same problem.
